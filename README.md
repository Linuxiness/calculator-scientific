# Casio scientific calculator

Using JavaScript.

I'm working on this project occasionally. 
I will work on it if I have nothing else to do. 
This is my hobby project, something I do in my spare time. 
I've always wanted to create a fully functional scientific calculator program that behaves like a normal scientific calculator. 
It brings me enjoyment whenever I find time to work on it.


If you want to help me, we can speed up the process of creating a fully functional calculator. 
My goal is to make it behave like a normal scientific calculator. 
The code should be in JavaScript, as I want to keep this hobby project as simple as possible.
